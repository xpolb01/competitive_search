The function "makeMove" is already written for you.
You do not need to modify it, but you should read it.

It will choose moves intelligently once minimax,
which it invokes, evaluates different board-states
intelligently.  It is the only function invoked when
you play against the computer after starting up
the server.

Input: A state object, representing the Connect 4 board.

Output: Returns an integer indicating the column
where the piece will be dropped.

This is the only function called when
you are playing against your agent.

  // state.legalMoves returns an array of integer values,
  // which indicate the locations (0 through 6)
  // where one can currently legally drop a piece.
  var allLegalMoves = state.legalMoves();

  // To get a successor state following a move,
  // just call state.move(someMove).  This returns
  // the board state after that move has been made.
  // It autmatically switches the player whose
  // move it is, and so on and so forth
  //
  // Note that state is immutable; invoking state.move
  // does NOT change the original state, but
  // returns a new one.
  var newState = state.move(allLegalMoves[0]);

  // from the array "arr" which has the greatest value
  // according to the function "func"

/*Max: Ancillary function.

Max returns the value from "arr" which is greatest
as evaluated by "func".

So for instance, if you passed
it [1,2,3,-4,-5], and (x) => Math.abs(x), it would return
-5, because -5 is the greatest element as evaluated by "func".

Similarly, if you passed it ["as","xxxxx","dns"] and
(x) => x.length, it would return "xxxxx"

/*
The function "heuristic" is one you must (mostly)
write.

Input: state, maximizingPlayer.  The state will be
a state object.  The maximizingPlayer will be either
an 'x' or an 'o', and is the player whose advantage
is signified by positive numbers.

Output: A number evaluating how good the state is from
the perspective of the player who is maximizing.

A useful method on state here would be state.numLines.
This function takes an integer and a player
like this "state.numLines(2,'x')" and returns the
number of lines of that length which that player
has.  That is, it returns the number of contiguous linear
pieces of that length that that player has.

This is useful because, generally speaking, it is better
to have lots of lines that fewer lines, and much better
to have longer lines than shorter lines.

You'll want to pass the tests defined in minimax_specs.js.

/*
The function "minimax" is one you must write.

Input: state, depth, maximizingPlayer.  The state is
an instance of a state object.  The depth is an integer
greater than zero; when it is zero, the minimax function
should return the value of the heuristic function.

Output: Returns a number evaluating the state, just
like heuristic does.

You'll need to use state.nextStates(), which returns
a list of possible successor states to the state passed in
as an argument.

You'll also probably need to use state.nextMovePlayer,
which returns whether the next moving player is 'x' or 'o',
to see if you are maximizing or minimizing.
